# Camera_Surveillance_System

📷 IoT-Based Motion Sensor Camera Surveillance System
🔒 With Telegram Control using ESP32-CAM
Welcome to our innovative surveillance system project! This system is designed to offer real-time security, smart automation, and remote access, all using cost-effective components like the ESP32-CAM, PIR sensor, and Telegram Bot API.


🧠 About the Project
In today’s world, the demand for intelligent and low-cost surveillance systems is growing. This project showcases a complete solution that:

✅ Detects motion using PIR sensor
✅ Captures images via ESP32-CAM
✅ Sends alerts & photos to Telegram instantly
✅ Monitors temperature and humidity with DHT11
✅ Controls devices like lights using a relay module

The system is built with embedded IoT technology and supports two-way communication via Telegram, eliminating the need for traditional CCTV monitors.



🔧 Hardware Used
📸 ESP32-CAM (with OV2640 Camera)
👀 PIR Sensor (Motion Detection)
🌡️ DHT11 (Temp & Humidity)
💡 Relay Module (for controlling lights/gate)
💻 FTDI Programmer (for uploading code)



💻 Software & Tools
